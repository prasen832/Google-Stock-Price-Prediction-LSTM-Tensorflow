1. RNN and LSTM are sequential learning models where LSTM is upgraded model of RNN.

2. The target in this project is to predict the next day Google stock price using LSTM
model.

3. A LSTM based neural network is designed with Keras in Tensorflow 2 to predict the
next day stock price.

4. The prediction stock price graph is exactly following the actual price graph.

The data file (CSV) is available above.
