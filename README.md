# Google Stock Prediction Using LSTM Tensorflow

![stock](Stock.jpg)

## Overview
1. RNN and LSTM are sequential learning models where LSTM is an upgraded model of RNN.
2. The target of this project is to predict the next day's Google stock  open price using LSTM model.
3. An LSTM-based neural network is designed with Keras in Tensorflow 2 to predict the next day's stock open price.
4. The prediction stock price graph is exactly following the actual price graph.
